[Carbonaut](https://carbonaut.dev/) is project to collect and refine environmental sustainability data from your IT infrastructure and make it available in a common data schema. The project does not implement a scraper to scan your IT infrastructure or measure your virtual machine energy, but integrates over providers which are implemented as plugins to integrate external data sources. The project is a POC and therefore not production ready.
