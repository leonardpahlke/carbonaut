# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to
one of our maintainers via a slack message - first, before
disclosing them in any public forums see [Carbonaut slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/carbonautgroup/shared_invite/zt-1rmr9yviv-aBXEaDp4JxTAgqOVD22TGg).
Thank you!

## When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Carbonaut
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Carbonaut
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Carbonaut depends on
- For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there

## When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Carbonaut components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related
