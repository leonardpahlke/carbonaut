# Carbonaut

**Carbonaut** is an open source project to collect and refine environmental sustainability data from your IT infrastructure and make it available in a common data schema as digestible metrics. Carbonaut does not implement a scraper to scan your IT infrastructure or measure your virtual machine energy, but integrates with these tools and brings it all together.
