# About Carbonaut

The Carbonaut project started in early 2022 with a few people from Liquid Reply intending to build some software project to improve the sustainability of a software system. After an initial research and brainstorming phase, we stopped the project in the summer of 2022 due to lack of a concrete vision and too much work to do on the side.

In the fall of 2022, we participated in a hackathon under the name Carbonaut and decided on an initial architecture and vision for the project. You can still find the project code in a [separate branch](https://github.com/carbonaut-cloud/carbonaut/tree/archive-carbonaut-legacy-carbonhack-nov-2022) in the core Carbonaut repository. Due to the size of the planned project and lack of time, we didn't get much done. We decided to stop the project for now, again.

In the winter of 2022 and early 2023, [Leonard Pahlke](https://github.com/leonardpahlke) resumed the project as a thesis project, with more or less the project plan from the hackathon. In March 2023, he redesigned the project from the ground up. Until now, we have followed the design. 

Carbonaut is an open-source cloud native software project which aims to establish transparency for energy used, emissions caused, IT-resources used and eventually, how which natural resources are used to run your software.
