# Carbonaut User Adoption

## Who is using Carbonaut?

Sharing experiences and learning from other users is essential. We adopt this type of document from other open source projects where this list has been very well received by adopters (ref [`cilium/USERS.md`](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/USERS.md)).

The following is a directory of adopters to help identify users of individual features. The users themselves directly maintain the list.

### Adding yourself as a user

If you are using Carbonaut or it is integrated into your product, service, or platform, please consider adding yourself as a user with a quick description of your use case by opening a pull request to this file and adding a section describing your usage of Carbonaut. If you are open to others contacting you about your use of Carbonaut on Slack, add your Slack nickname as well.

```
N: Name of user (company or individual)
D: Description
U: Usage of features
L: Link with further information (optional)
Q: Contacts available for questions (optional)
```

### Example entry:

```
* N: Carbonaut Example User Inc.
  D: Carbonaut Example User Inc. is using Carbonaut for scientific purposes
  U: Kubernetes Integrations
  Q: @slacknick1, @slacknick2
```

### Requirements to be listed
* You must represent the user listed. Do NOT add entries on behalf of other users.
* There is no minimum deployment size but we request to list permanent deployments only, i.e., no demo or trial deployments. Commercial or production use is not required. A well-done home lab setup can be equally interesting as a large-scale commercial deployment.
