## **Carbonaut: How To Run**

{{< hint danger >}}
The current Carbonaut version is a POC (Proof of Concept). The project is not tested for large environments. There are already several security and quality checks, but no security assessment has been done and there is a risk of vulnerabilities if it is deployed. The system is not hardened.
{{< /hint >}}

Carbonaut can be run as binary or container. The latest releases can be found [here](https://github.com/leonardpahlke/carbonaut/releases).
