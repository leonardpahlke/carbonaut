Carbonaut is project to collect and refine environmental sustainability data from your IT infrastructure and make it available in a common [data schema](docs/reference/schema/data-schema). The project does not implement a scraper to scan your IT infrastructure or measure your virtual machine energy, but integrates over [provider interfaces](docs/reference/schema/provider-schema) external data sources. Some [plugins](docs/concepts/plugins) are developed to integrate data already. The project is a POC and therefore not production ready. If you like to [contribute](docs/reference/contributing) you are very welcome to do so!
